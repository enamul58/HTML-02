                Whilst many of us are aware of the term itself, most of us are not educated sufficiently.
                Menstruation is <strong>basically the discharge of blood</strong>, uterine lining, mucus lining of the vagina, red blood cells, and old cellular tissue.
                Now, <mark>the reason women get their periods is because</mark> of their menstrual cycle, which is simply a consequence of the rise and fall of hormones.
                The uterine lining is thickened with blood vessels in preparation of possible pregnancy. When pregnancy does not occur, the lining sheds itself, accompanied by bleeding for 3 to 7 days.
                The menstrual cycle starts on the first day of one period till the first day of the next period, lasting 21 to 35 days. Usually, girls aged between 12 and 15 get their period for the first time. Under normal circumstances, menstruation stops after menopause—the stoppage of menstrual cycle—which usually occurs between 45 and 55 years of age.
